# Product Comparison

### Preface

In today's rapidly changing IT environment, organizations increasingly rely on a comprehensive set of monitoring and incident management tools to ensure business continuity and service stability. However, as the monitoring system continues to expand, a massive number of alerts and event notifications are generated, presenting unprecedented challenges to IT teams. Ensuring that every alert is captured in a timely manner, delivered accurately, and responded to effectively has become crucial for maintaining service quality.

Faced with this challenge, the following scenarios indicate that organizations need to introduce or upgrade their On-Call tools:

- **Comprehensive Tracking and Resolution**: Ensure that every incident can be tracked, processed, and resolved to prevent the problem from escalating and avoid significant asset losses.
- **Establishment of a Duty Mechanism**: Establish a clear On-Call personnel duty mechanism, including a primary and backup shift system, to reasonably share responsibilities and avoid alert overload.
- **Improving Response Efficiency**: When SRE or R&D personnel spend more than 25% of their time on On-Call duties, tools are needed to reduce noise and improve work efficiency.
- **Establishment of Quantitative Metrics**: Establish metrics for incident processing timeliness and personnel workload to drive continuous improvement in service stability through data.

**"What key factors should we consider when purchasing On-Call services?"** This guide will provide comprehensive On-Call tool purchasing recommendations. We will explore the three dimensions of **product**, **service**, and **price** to help IT managers identify the questions they should ask when looking for efficient collaboration and incident management solutions for their development and operations teams. Additionally, we will provide comparative analyses of leading domestic and international On-Call suppliers such as Flashduty and Pagerduty to assist you in making an informed decision.
