# DingTalk Integration

By integrating DingTalk's self-built applications, the ability to receive and respond to alerts within the DingTalk terminal is achieved.

**(This document uses the new version of the DingTalk Open Platform as an example)**

## Create DingTalk Application

### 1. Create a Self-Built Application

Visit [the DingTalk developer backend](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app) - Application Development - Internal Enterprise Development, and create an application. (For details, refer to the DingTalk development documentation - [Creating Internal Enterprise Applications - H5 Micro Applications](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/orgapp/microapplication-creation-and-release-process#title-ovn-666-1ty))

The application icon can use the [Flashduty official icon](https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashcat_logo_circular.png).

### 2. Copy the Enterprise CorpId

Click on the company in the upper right corner of the page, and in the drop-down menu, copy the `CorpId` for backup.

### 3. Copy Application Credential Information

Go to the **Credentials and Basic Information** page and copy the `AgentID`, `ClientID`, and `ClientSecret` for later use.

### 4. Copy Event Subscription Information

Go to the **Development Configuration - Events and Callbacks** page.

Generate **encryption aes_key** and **signature Token** for backup.

**(Note: After generating the aes_key and Token, please temporarily save the information elsewhere. The information will disappear after leaving the page and will be needed later)**

### 5. Apply for Application Permissions
