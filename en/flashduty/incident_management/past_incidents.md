# Understand historical failures

---

Check historical solutions for similar failures to address new issues promptly.

---

When responding to failures, having access to solutions for similar historical issues can significantly expedite the resolution process. The historical failure feature provides responders with a list of resolved similar failures. For those unfamiliar with the issue, they can quickly review the timeline, root causes, and solutions of past failures, and replicate relevant actions. Historical failures offer the necessary context for problem-solving and help prevent panic among responders encountering unfamiliar issues.

## View Similar Failures
---

### Console

1. Locate a failure that requires attention from the failure list or collaboration space
2. Click on the failure title to enter the details, and select the **Historical Failures** tab within the details.

The system will provide up to 5 similar historical failures to avoid excessive time spent on reviewing and identifying information.

### Sorting Principles

How do we sort?

1. The system only matches failures with a similarity greater than 90%
2. The system prioritizes returning failures with more detailed solutions and root causes
3. The system prioritizes returning failures with higher similarity
4. The system returns the most recent failures first.

> [!NOTE]
> Recording the **solution** and **root cause** of each resolved failure is a good practice that greatly enhances the efficiency of subsequent responders.


### How to Identify

The system uses a machine learning model to determine the similarity between failures. When the similarity exceeds 90%, we consider the two failures to be similar.

When assessing similarity, we primarily consider the following factors:

1. Failure title
2. Detailed description of the failure
3. The service affected by the failure (usually extracted from the service tag)
4. Alarm objects included in the failure (usually extracted from the resource tag)

When searching for historical failures, the system only matches resolved similar failures within the current collaboration space.


## FAQs
---

<details><summary>How far back can I view historical faults?</summary> Currently, you can only view similar faults within 30 days before the current fault occurs. Over time, the system may delete historical data, in which case you may not be able to view historical faults.<p> Regardless, you can view up to 30 days of historical data for a currently occurring failure.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I mark that the current fault is not similar to historical faults?</summary><p> No, the system currently does not have a marking function. But you can communicate and give feedback to us through other channels.</p></details>
<details><summary>How can I make historical glitches work better?</summary> 1. It is recommended that you fill in the root causes and solutions for important faults; 2. It is recommended that you try to enrich the labels of faults, especially the service and resource tags; 3. It is recommended that you enrich the titles and descriptions of alarms to make them more accurate. Express the fault phenomenon.</details>
