# Configure Single Sign-On

---

FlashDuty currently offers single sign-on (SSO) support for SAML2.0, OIDC, CAS, and LDAP (available only in the private version), making it effortless to integrate with various applications and platforms. These functionalities enable rapid sharing of identity information across platforms. Users need to authenticate only once on a single platform to access multiple related applications and services, eliminating the need for individual authentication for each app. This not only enhances work efficiency and user experience but also streamlines the login process and fortifies security.
