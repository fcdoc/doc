# Configure Duty Rules

Duty rules are a core component of a company's internal management approach, helping businesses to arrange staff working hours rationally, ensuring business continuity and efficiency. FlashDuty's duty schedule offers a variety of duty rules that can be tailored to fit the actual business needs of an enterprise.

## Duty Schedule
1. On the duty management page, you can view a summary of all your duty assignments.
2. Principal members can see all duty schedules or only those they manage.
3. Before setting up duty rules, it is necessary to first create a duty list, which can also be associated with a team for maintenance and planning by its members.
4. When creating a duty schedule, the notification method for shift changes can be configured flexibly:
- Notification Time: Notify the next person on duty N minutes in advance during shift handovers
- Notification Channels: Individual chat (one-on-one notifications via SMS, voice calls, emails, etc.) or group chat (messages pushed to an IM group with @ mentions for assigned personnel).

### Duty Rules Composition

- Duty rules, combined with shift adjustment rules, form the comprehensive duty schedule.
- Duty rules can be viewed from a timeline or calendar perspective to see the final duty arrangement.

### Edit Rules
#### 1. Create

- A single duty schedule can accommodate multiple duty rules to meet various business requirements.
- When organizing duty rosters, consider duty times and rotation cycles carefully to prevent gaps in service.
#### 2. Change

- Place the cursor over a rule and click to bring up the rule configuration dialog box.
- Modifications to the established duty scheduling regulations will not impact historical records, encompassing the addition/removal of on-duty staff or adjustments to duty hours.
- Changes to rules take effect immediately upon saving.

#### 3. Delete

- Once a rule is deleted, it cannot be recovered, so please exercise caution.
- Deletions take effect immediately. Please confirm that no services are still using the rule before proceeding.

#### 4. Temporary Shift Change
- Temporary shift changes are primarily used in pre-planned duty arrangements, such as when a duty person is unavailable or on leave and needs a colleague to cover their shift.
- Before making a shift change, ensure clear communication with the substitute regarding the duty times. While there will be notifications during shift handovers, there will be no system notifications for real-time adjustments that take immediate effect.
