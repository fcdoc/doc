## Create Calendar
---
**Navigate to Console => Fault Management => Service Calendar => Add Calendar to create.**
- It is recommended to name the calendar based on the business dimension, for example, "Settlement Business System."
- The calendar description should provide an overview of the business characteristics and logic, allowing team members to quickly grasp the information.
- After configuring team members to manage the calendar, they will have full permissions for that calendar.
- Newly created calendars are set to all working days by default. It is generally advised to link them directly to national holidays to automatically incorporate holiday schedules, thus saving the manual marking process. Even after linking, manual adjustments can still be made as needed.
